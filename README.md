# Build Your Own Event Store

My work for [Oskar Dudycz's "Build Your Own Event Store"][1] self-paced workshop.

- **2023-08-18:** I'm making the conscious decision to wrap this up after exercise 7, leaving exercises 8-10 incomplete. (Exercise 11 is specific to the Marten library (which is a C# project), so I was never going to do it.) At this point, my custom event store has all the features of EventStoreDB. Aggregates and repositories (exercise 8), snapshots (exercise 9), and projections (exercise 10) would just be icing on the cake. I can always come back to these exercises if I run into trouble trying to implement these features on an actual project. 

I already started a branch for exercise 8.
