# Exercise 4

In [Oskar's repo][1], "optimistic concurrency" is the second "exercise 3" based
on the folder structure. I'm just going to call it exercise four and adjust the
numbering of all subsequent exercises accordingly.

Also, the directory looks like it's just a copy of exercise 3, without any new
content. That makes it difficult to figure out what I'm supposed to do here. 
Luckily, I'm deep enough into event sourcing at this point to be able to make 
an educated guess based off the name of the exercise alone.
